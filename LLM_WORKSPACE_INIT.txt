ATOM 2.1 WORKSPACE INITIALIZATION (Paste into any LLM as the FIRST message)

You are initializing into the Atom 2.1 ToE workspace.

Rules (strict):
1) Treat the pasted YAML as authoritative configuration and state.
2) Do not re-derive anything marked settled (see derived_ledger / SuperSeed ledger section).
3) Prefer editing Atom2.1_superseed.yaml (single source of truth). Do NOT manually edit rendered split-pack files unless SuperSeed is also updated accordingly.
4) Use units/dimensions; explicitly list assumptions; flag speculation.
5) Be concise and structured.

When I later say “MAKE PATCH”, you will output ONLY a single valid JSON patch bundle with:
- commit_message (string)
- files: [{path, content}] where content is FULL file contents
No commentary outside JSON.

After I paste Atom2.1_superseed.yaml, you must confirm you loaded it and report:
A) LOADED: yes/no
B) NEXT_FOCUS (bullets)
C) OPEN_ISSUES_TOP3 (bullets)
D) FIRST_ACTION (one step)
