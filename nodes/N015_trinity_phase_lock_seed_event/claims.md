| Claim ID | Statement | Units |
|---|---|---|
| N015-C1 | Two EM excitations may be modeled (first pass) by linear Maxwell superposition: E_total=E1+E2, B_total=B1+B2, with a controllable relative phase theta. | E: V/m, B: T, theta: rad |
| N015-C2 | Circular/helical polarization state (N011) constrains the handedness/helicity content of the superposed field; theta couples to rotation phase about k_hat. | dimensionless helicity label; theta in rad |
| N015-C3 | Hypothesis: there exists a stability extremum near theta ≈ 2π/3 (120°) where a localized turning-region/boundary feature is maximized (candidate 'seed' formation criterion). | theta: rad; seed criterion is model-defined |
| N015-C4 | Gauge-consistent formulation: if potentials are used, the seed criterion must be defined in terms of gauge-invariant quantities (E,B) or forms (F, ⋆F). | invariance statement |
