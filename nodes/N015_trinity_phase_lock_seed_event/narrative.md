# N015 — Trinity phase-lock seed event (two-wave → newmode)

## Purpose
This node introduces the **first Atom 2.1 constructive hypothesis**:

> Two EM excitations, when combined with a relative phase offset near **120°**, may maximize a localized **turning-region / boundary feature** that acts as a candidate *newmode seed*.

This is written to stay consistent with:
- **N010** (forms + topology hook)
- **N011** (helicity / handedness conventions)
- **N012** (potentials + gauge invariance)

## What this node is (and is not)
- **Is:** a disciplined way to state the *Trinity (120°) phase-lock hypothesis* and define what must be true for it to be meaningful.
- **Is not:** a full proton/neutrino derivation. Matter-specific sources are deferred to later nodes.

## Inputs
Two localized EM excitations (wave packets or plane-wave components), parameterized by:
- amplitude, frequency, polarization/helicity
- propagation alignment
- relative phase **theta**

## Core hypothesis
There exists a **stability extremum** near:

- theta ≈ 2π/3 (120°)

for a **gauge-invariant turning-region functional** S(E,B) that measures “seed-likeness.”

## Why gauge invariance matters
If the seed criterion depends on potentials (A, phi), it must be re-expressed in terms of gauge-invariant quantities:
- fields E,B (N012)
- or forms F, ⋆F (N010)

## Atom 2.1 handoff
Later nodes will:
- choose a specific S(E,B) (or S(F,⋆F))
- test theta-scans numerically (M2/M3)
- specialize input families to Atom 2.1 matter sources (proton knot modes, CMB-spectrum forcing)
