scope:
  domain: "Atom 2.1 constructive step (EM superposition + phase-lock hypothesis)"

  units: "SI (default)"

definitions:
  - symbol: "E1,E2"
    meaning: "input electric fields (two excitations/wave packets)"
    units: "V/m"
  - symbol: "B1,B2"
    meaning: "input magnetic fields"
    units: "T"
  - symbol: "A1,A2"
    meaning: "input vector potentials"
    units: "V·s/m"
  - symbol: "theta"
    meaning: "relative phase offset between inputs (candidate stability angle)"
    units: "rad"
  - symbol: "k_hat"
    meaning: "local propagation direction unit vector"
    units: "dimensionless"
  - symbol: "seed"
    meaning: "candidate boundary/turning-region excitation descriptor (newmode hypothesis)"
    units: "dimensionless + parameter set"

claims:
  - id: N015-C1
    statement: "Two EM excitations may be modeled (first pass) by linear Maxwell superposition: E_total=E1+E2, B_total=B1+B2, with a controllable relative phase theta."
    units: "E: V/m, B: T, theta: rad"
  - id: N015-C2
    statement: "Circular/helical polarization state (N011) constrains the handedness/helicity content of the superposed field; theta couples to rotation phase about k_hat."
    units: "dimensionless helicity label; theta in rad"
  - id: N015-C3
    statement: "Hypothesis: there exists a stability extremum near theta ≈ 2π/3 (120°) where a localized turning-region/boundary feature is maximized (candidate 'seed' formation criterion)."
    units: "theta: rad; seed criterion is model-defined"
  - id: N015-C4
    statement: "Gauge-consistent formulation: if potentials are used, the seed criterion must be defined in terms of gauge-invariant quantities (E,B) or forms (F, ⋆F)."
    units: "invariance statement"

assumptions:
  - "First-pass uses linear Maxwell superposition; nonlinearity/topology enters via boundary/turning-region criteria (to be refined)."
  - "Handedness conventions follow N011; form conventions follow N010; potential conventions follow N012."
  - "Speculative claims are flagged; quantified predictions deferred to M2/M3."

validation:
  checks:
    - "Define a concrete gauge-invariant 'seed functional' S(E,B) and verify invariance under gauge transforms (via N012)."
    - "Scan theta in a toy two-wave model and confirm whether S(E,B) shows an extremum near 2π/3 (if not, revise hypothesis)."
    - "Ensure handedness conventions in S(E,B) match N011." 
  falsifiers:
    - "If no reasonable gauge-invariant turning-region functional yields a stability extremum near 120° for any physically plausible input family, the Trinity phase-lock hypothesis (as stated) fails."
