# N000 — Space, Time, Light (Maxwell baseline)

## Purpose
Establish the classical baseline: in Cartesian space (x,y,z) with time t, Maxwell’s equations in vacuum imply electromagnetic waves (light) propagating at speed c.

## Maxwell’s equations (vacuum)
Assume charge density rho=0 and current density J=0.

1) Gauss (electric):  ∇·E = 0
2) Gauss (magnetic):  ∇·B = 0
3) Faraday:           ∇×E = −∂B/∂t
4) Ampère–Maxwell:    ∇×B = μ0 ε0 ∂E/∂t

Right-hand rule refers to the orientation convention for curls/cross-products.

## Key consequence: wave equation
From Faraday + Ampère–Maxwell:

∇²E = μ0 ε0 ∂²E/∂t²
∇²B = μ0 ε0 ∂²B/∂t²

Therefore the propagation speed is:

c = 1/√(μ0 ε0)

## Atom 2.1 handoff
This node defines baseline constraints that Atom 2.1 must reproduce in the appropriate limit.
