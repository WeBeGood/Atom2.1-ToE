# N000 Claims — Space, Time, Light (Maxwell baseline)

Generated from `node.yaml` by `scripts/build_node_claims.py`. Commit this file.

| Claim ID | Statement | Units |
|---|---|---|
| N000-C1 | Maxwell's equations in vacuum imply wave solutions for E and B that propagate at c. | E: V/m, B: T, c: m/s |
| N000-C2 | For plane waves in vacuum, E and B are transverse to propagation and mutually orthogonal. | dimensionless geometry; E,B units as above |
| N000-C3 | Energy flux is S=(1/mu0) E×B (Poynting vector). | S: W/m^2 |
