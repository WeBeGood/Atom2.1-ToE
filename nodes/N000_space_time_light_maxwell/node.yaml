scope:
  domain: "Classical electromagnetism"
  coordinate_system: "Cartesian (x,y,z), time t"
  units: "SI (default)"

claims:
  - id: N000-C1
    statement: "Maxwell's equations in vacuum imply wave solutions for E and B that propagate at c."
    units: "E: V/m, B: T, c: m/s"
  - id: N000-C2
    statement: "For plane waves in vacuum, E and B are transverse to propagation and mutually orthogonal."
    units: "dimensionless geometry; E,B units as above"
  - id: N000-C3
    statement: "Energy flux is S=(1/mu0) E×B (Poynting vector)."
    units: "S: W/m^2"

assumptions:
  - "Vacuum (rho=0, J=0)."
  - "Flat Euclidean space coordinates for the baseline (prior to Atom 2.1 extensions)."
  - "Standard vector calculus identities apply."
