# N010 Notation + Conventions

## Spacetime
- Coordinates: x^\mu, with \mu = 0..3
- x^0 is time coordinate (convention stated in forms_derivation.md)

## Differential forms
- d: exterior derivative
- ∧: wedge product
- ⋆: Hodge star operator (metric-dependent)

## EM objects
- A: 1-form (potential)
- F: 2-form (field strength), F = dA locally when dF=0
- J: 3-form current (encodes rho and current density)
