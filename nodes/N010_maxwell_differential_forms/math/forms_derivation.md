# N010 Math Track — Maxwell in Differential Forms (3+1 split)

## Goal
Show that the compact form equations reproduce N000’s vector Maxwell equations under explicit conventions.

## Maxwell (forms)
- Homogeneous: dF = 0
- Inhomogeneous: d⋆F = J
In vacuum, J = 0.

## Next steps (to be expanded)
1) Define F in terms of E and B using a chosen sign/metric convention.
2) Compute dF and identify components corresponding to:
   - ∇·B = 0
   - ∇×E = −∂B/∂t
3) Compute d⋆F and identify components corresponding to:
   - ∇·E = ρ/ε0 (vacuum baseline is 0)
   - ∇×B = μ0 J + μ0 ε0 ∂E/∂t (vacuum baseline is μ0 ε0 ∂E/∂t)
4) State topology note: dF=0 ⇒ F is closed; globally exact iff cohomology class vanishes.
