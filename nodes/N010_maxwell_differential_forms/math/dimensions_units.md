# N010 Units + Dimensional Notes

This node is primarily geometric; units live in the components when performing a 3+1 split into E and B.

## Key sanity
- F encodes E and B, so component units inherit from N000:
  - E: V/m
  - B: T
- A encodes scalar potential and vector potential (component-dependent units).
