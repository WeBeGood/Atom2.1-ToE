# N010 Claims — Maxwell in differential forms (topology-ready)

Generated from `node.yaml` by `scripts/build_node_claims.py`. Commit this file.

| Claim ID | Statement | Units |
|---|---|---|
| N010-C1 | Maxwell's equations can be written compactly as dF=0 and d⋆F=J (or 0 in vacuum). | form equations |
| N010-C2 | dF=0 implies locally F=dA (gauge potential exists on simply connected regions). | form equation |
| N010-C3 | Topology enters via global obstructions: nontrivial cohomology can prevent a single global A even when dF=0. | topological statement |
