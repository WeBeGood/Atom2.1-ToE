definitions:
  - symbol: "F"
    meaning: "electromagnetic field strength 2-form"
    units: "encodes E and B"
  - symbol: "A"
    meaning: "electromagnetic potential 1-form"
    units: "V (time component), V·s/m (space components)"
  - symbol: "d"

claims:
  - id: N010-C1
    statement: "Maxwell's equations can be written compactly as dF=0 and d⋆F=J (or 0 in vacuum)."
    units: "form equations"
  - id: N010-C2
    statement: "dF=0 implies locally F=dA (gauge potential exists on simply connected regions)."
    units: "form equation"
  - id: N010-C3
    statement: "Topology enters via global obstructions: nontrivial cohomology can prevent a single global A even when dF=0."
    units: "topological statement"

assumptions:
  - "Classical EM; smooth manifolds; standard differential geometry." 
  - "Vacuum baseline corresponds to J=0." 
  - "Metric choice (signature) affects ⋆ conventions; we will state conventions explicitly in math track."

validation:
  checks:
    - "Map dF=0 to Gauss(B) + Faraday in 3+1 split."

  falsifiers:
    - "If the 3+1 split does not reproduce the standard vector Maxwell equations under stated conventions."
