# N012 — EM potentials and gauge (quantization on-ramp)

## Purpose
Introduce the **potentials (phi, A)** and **gauge freedom** as the natural objects for:
- compact derivations of Maxwell
- bridge to the differential-forms view (A is a 1-form)
- later quantization (A_mu as the field)

## Definitions
- B = ∇×A
- E = −∇phi − ∂A/∂t

## Gauge invariance
The transformation
- A → A + ∇Lambda
- phi → phi − ∂Lambda/∂t
leaves E and B unchanged.

## Gauge choice (Lorenz gauge)
A common gauge condition is the Lorenz gauge (spacetime-divergence constraint).
Under this gauge, potentials satisfy wave equations sourced by rho and J.
In vacuum (rho=0, J=0), potentials satisfy homogeneous wave equations.

## Atom 2.1 handoff
Potentials are a clean staging point for:
- topology (A as a connection-like object; global obstructions)
- quantization and mode counting
- later “two-photon → new mode” constructions with explicit gauge constraints
