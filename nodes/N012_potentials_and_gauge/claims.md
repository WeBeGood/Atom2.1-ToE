# N012 Claims — EM potentials and gauge (quantization on-ramp)

Generated from `node.yaml` by `scripts/build_node_claims.py`. Commit this file.

| Claim ID | Statement | Units |
|---|---|---|
| N012-C1 | Magnetic field can be written as B = ∇×A. | B: T, A: V·s/m |
| N012-C2 | Electric field can be written as E = −∇phi − ∂A/∂t. | E: V/m |
| N012-C3 | Gauge freedom: A→A+∇Lambda, phi→phi−∂Lambda/∂t leaves E and B invariant. | invariance statement |
| N012-C4 | In Lorenz gauge, potentials satisfy wave equations sourced by charge/current. | wave PDEs |
