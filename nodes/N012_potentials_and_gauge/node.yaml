claims:
  - id: N012-C1
    statement: "Magnetic field can be written as B = ∇×A."
    units: "B: T, A: V·s/m"
  - id: N012-C2
    statement: "Electric field can be written as E = −∇phi − ∂A/∂t."
    units: "E: V/m"
  - id: N012-C3
    statement: "Gauge freedom: A→A+∇Lambda, phi→phi−∂Lambda/∂t leaves E and B invariant."
    units: "invariance statement"
  - id: N012-C4
    statement: "In Lorenz gauge, potentials satisfy wave equations sourced by charge/current."
    units: "wave PDEs"

assumptions:
  - "Smooth fields; standard vector calculus identities." 
  - "Vacuum baseline corresponds to rho=0, J=0, giving homogeneous wave equations." 
  - "Gauge convention (Lorenz vs Coulomb) must be stated explicitly."
