# N011 — Polarization, helicity, chirality baseline (plane waves)

## Purpose
Create an intuitive, visualization-friendly baseline for **handedness** in EM waves.
This becomes a bridge toward Atom 2.1 chirality/topology narratives.

## Plane-wave recap (from N000)
For a plane wave propagating along k̂:
- E ⟂ k̂
- B ⟂ k̂
- E ⟂ B

## Two degrees of freedom
Because E must remain transverse, a plane wave has **two independent polarization modes**.
Common bases:
- Linear polarization: (x̂, ŷ)
- Circular polarization: (ê_L, ê_R)

## Circular polarization and handedness
A circularly polarized wave has E rotating in the plane perpendicular to k̂.
We will define explicit conventions:
- what “left-handed” means (as viewed looking along +k or against it)
- how that maps to helicity labels

## Atom 2.1 handoff
This node locks down the conventions and geometry of chirality for waves.
Later nodes can connect this to topology (twist/helicity invariants, knotting, braid constraints).
