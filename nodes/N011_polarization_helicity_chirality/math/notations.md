# N011 Notation + Conventions

## Propagation
- Choose propagation direction k̂. For worked examples, take k̂ = ẑ.

## Polarization basis
- Linear basis: x̂, ŷ
- Circular basis: ê_± = (x̂ ± i ŷ)/sqrt(2)

## Handedness convention (to be explicit)
We will state which viewing direction defines “left” vs “right” rotation.
(Important: different communities swap sign conventions.)
