# N011 Claims — Polarization, helicity, chirality baseline (plane waves)

Generated from `node.yaml` by `scripts/build_node_claims.py`. Commit this file.

| Claim ID | Statement | Units |
|---|---|---|
| N011-C1 | Plane-wave solutions admit two transverse polarization degrees of freedom. | dimensionless |
| N011-C2 | Circular polarizations correspond to definite helicity (left/right-handed rotation about k). | dimensionless |
| N011-C3 | Helicity/chirality language provides a natural bridge from classical wave geometry to topology-first descriptions. | conceptual bridge |
