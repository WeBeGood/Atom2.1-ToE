# N016 Claims — CMB-spectrum seeded Beltrami line (Trinity phase-lock extension)

Generated from `node.yaml` by `scripts/build_node_claims.py`. Commit this file.

| Claim ID | Statement | Units |
|---|---|---|
| N016-C1 | Given a seed criterion S(E,B) from N015, repeated/propagated satisfaction of the criterion along an axis defines a candidate extended object ('seed-line') with direction k_hat. | k_hat dimensionless; line has length scale(s) in m |
| N016-C2 | Broadband background forcing can be modeled by a spectral distribution u_nu(ν; T_cmb) that provides persistent multi-frequency drive; this is a constraint/driver term, not a nonlinear Maxwell modification. | u_nu: J/m^3/Hz; T_cmb: K |
| N016-C3 | Beltrami candidate family: impose ∇×A = kappa A as an organizing ansatz for line-like helical modes; kappa sets an inverse length scale for twist density. | kappa: 1/m; A: V·s/m |
| N016-C4 | Helicity/handedness conventions from N011 must be consistent with the Beltrami ansatz and with the seed functional’s sensitivity to chirality. | dimensionless helicity label |
| N016-C5 | CMB may become load-bearing in later nodes when used to constrain constants and rest-mass scales; in N016 it is introduced as a formally defined spectral driver/constraint. | scoping statement |
