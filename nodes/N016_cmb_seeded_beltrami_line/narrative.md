# N016 — CMB-spectrum seeded Beltrami line (Trinity phase-lock extension)

## Purpose
Extend **N015’s local seed event** into a candidate **line-like field structure** under persistent broadband forcing.

This node is the first step toward the Atom 2.1 “seed-line / Beltrami neutrino line” concept, without prematurely claiming particle identity.

## What this node asserts (M1)
1) A **seed** is defined locally by a gauge-invariant functional S(E,B) (from N015).
2) A **seed-line** is defined by *propagating or repeating* that criterion along an axis k̂.
3) The **CMB spectrum** is introduced as a formally defined broadband driver/constraint, via u_ν(ν; T_cmb).
4) A **Beltrami family** (∇×A = κA) is introduced as an organizing ansatz for helical/line-like modes.

## CMB is introduced here; load-bearing comes later
In N016, CMB enters as:
- a **spectral forcing / background constraint**
- a source of multi-frequency drive for mode-locking hypotheses

Later nodes may elevate CMB to **load-bearing**, where it constrains constants, rest-mass scales, and cosmological observables (e.g., H₀).
That upgrade must be explicit, justified, and testable.

## Beltrami as organizing ansatz
Beltrami fields are “curl-eigenfields”:

∇×A = κA

This does not modify Maxwell; it selects a candidate mode family with a built-in twist scale κ.

## Historical / ontology note: Kelvin “aether” (non-load-bearing)
Atom 2.1 often resembles a **modernized aether-like picture** (Kelvin-era intuition) in the sense of a universal medium.
Here we treat that as:
- a historical alignment / interpretation
- **not** a premise required for the mathematical claims of N016

## Atom 2.1 handoff
Next nodes can:
- choose a specific S(E,B) from N015 and test stability numerically
- connect seed-line candidates to neutrino phenomenology
- promote CMB from “constraint” to “load-bearing” when constants/masses are derived rather than inserted
