# N016 Math Track — Beltrami Ansatz

## Beltrami family
A Beltrami field is an eigenfield of curl:

∇×A = κ A

κ sets an inverse length scale for twist density.

## Why use it here?
As an **organizing ansatz** for line-like helical modes that can carry stable handedness.

## Constraints
- Must remain consistent with gauge handling from N012
- Must be compatible with helicity conventions from N011

## Next step
Provide at least one explicit example (analytic or numeric) and connect its invariants/helicity proxies to candidate seed criteria.
