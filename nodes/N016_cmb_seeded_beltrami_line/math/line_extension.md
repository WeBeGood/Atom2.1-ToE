# N016 Math Track — Line Extension from Seed Criterion

## Goal
Define what it means for a local seed event (N015) to extend into a line-like structure.

## Minimal definition (M1)
Let S(E,B) be the seed functional.
Define a line axis k_hat and a curve/axis parameter s.
A candidate seed-line can be defined by a condition like:

S(E(s),B(s)) ≥ S_threshold for s in [0, L]

where L is the candidate line length.

## Notes
- This is a structural definition; it becomes physical when E,B are specified by a candidate mode family (e.g., Beltrami) and a forcing model (e.g., CMB spectral constraint).

## Next step
- choose a toy model for E,B or A
- compute S along an axis and test whether persistent satisfaction is possible
