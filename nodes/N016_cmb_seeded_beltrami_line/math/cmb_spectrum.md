# N016 Math Track — CMB Spectrum Interface u_ν(ν; T_cmb)

## Goal
Define a formally correct spectral forcing/constraint interface for the CMB background.

## Minimal requirement (M1)
Provide a function u_ν(ν; T_cmb) with units:
- J/m^3/Hz

## Notes
- The exact dataset or measurement source can be cited later.
- In N016, u_ν is used as a **driver/constraint**, not as a direct “cause” of nonlinearity.

## Upgrade hook (later nodes)
If CMB becomes load-bearing, we will explicitly connect:
- T_cmb and/or spectral moments to derived constants and mass scales
- testable cosmological observables
