scope:
  domain: "Atom 2.1 extension: seed event → extended line under broadband (CMB) forcing"
  coordinate_system: "Cartesian baseline; compatible with forms/potentials; axis defined by k_hat"
  units: "SI (default)"

definitions:
  - symbol: "T_cmb"
    meaning: "CMB blackbody temperature (parameter)"
    units: "K"
  - symbol: "u_nu"
    meaning: "spectral energy density of CMB (per frequency)"
    units: "J/m^3/Hz"
  - symbol: "A"
    meaning: "vector potential (candidate Beltrami family)"
    units: "V·s/m"
  - symbol: "kappa"
    meaning: "Beltrami proportionality constant in ∇×A = kappa A"
    units: "1/m"
  - symbol: "k_hat"
    meaning: "local line axis / propagation direction unit vector"
    units: "dimensionless"
  - symbol: "seed"
    meaning: "seed descriptor exported by N015"

  - symbol: "line"
    meaning: "extended seed-line object (topological/field descriptor)"
    units: "dimensionless + length scale(s)"

claims:
  - id: N016-C1
    statement: "Given a seed criterion S(E,B) from N015, repeated/propagated satisfaction of the criterion along an axis defines a candidate extended object ('seed-line') with direction k_hat."
    units: "k_hat dimensionless; line has length scale(s) in m"
  - id: N016-C2
    statement: "Broadband background forcing can be modeled by a spectral distribution u_nu(ν; T_cmb) that provides persistent multi-frequency drive; this is a constraint/driver term, not a nonlinear Maxwell modification."
    units: "u_nu: J/m^3/Hz; T_cmb: K"
  - id: N016-C3
    statement: "Beltrami candidate family: impose ∇×A = kappa A as an organizing ansatz for line-like helical modes; kappa sets an inverse length scale for twist density."
    units: "kappa: 1/m; A: V·s/m"
  - id: N016-C4
    statement: "Helicity/handedness conventions from N011 must be consistent with the Beltrami ansatz and with the seed functional’s sensitivity to chirality."
    units: "dimensionless helicity label"
  - id: N016-C5
    statement: "CMB may become load-bearing in later nodes when used to constrain constants and rest-mass scales; in N016 it is introduced as a formally defined spectral driver/constraint."
    units: "scoping statement"

assumptions:
  - "N015 provides (or will provide) a concrete gauge-invariant seed functional S(E,B)."
  - "Beltrami ansatz is used as a candidate mode family; acceptance depends on later stability/fit tests."
  - "CMB spectrum is introduced as a background forcing/constraint; load-bearing upgrades are deferred to later nodes and must be explicitly justified."

validation:
  checks:
    - "Define an explicit u_nu(ν; T_cmb) and ensure dimensional correctness (J/m^3/Hz)."
    - "Provide at least one concrete Beltrami field example (analytic or numeric) consistent with N011 handedness conventions."
    - "Define a propagated line criterion and show it reduces to N015 seed event locally."
  falsifiers:
    - "If no physically plausible seed functional from N015 can be extended into a stable line-like structure under any reasonable forcing model, the seed-line extension hypothesis fails."
    - "If Beltrami ansatz cannot be made consistent with gauge constraints and/or yields no stable candidate modes, it must be replaced as organizing family."
