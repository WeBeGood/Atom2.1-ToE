# First Yaml — Atom 2.1 bootstrap seed (minimal, repo-smoke-test)
meta:
  name: "First Yaml"
  schema: "atom2.1.seed"
  version: "0.1.0"
  created_utc: "2026-02-19"
  author: "WeBeGood"
  purpose:
    - "Proof: read/write YAML file to GitHub"
    - "Bootstrap: initialize LLM/human/simulation into Atom 2.1 framing"
  license_hint: "All rights reserved unless explicitly stated otherwise."

boot:
  how_to_use:
    - "LLM: Load this YAML, then adopt contract.rules strictly."
    - "Human: Treat as an orientation + operating contract."
    - "Simulation: Map primitives + axioms into initial conditions and constraints."

contract:
  rules:
    continuity_rule: "Continue from active_state_pointer; do not restart from scratch."
    no_rederive_rule: "Do not re-derive items listed in derived_ledger unless explicitly requested."
    scope_rule: "Stay inside Atom 2.1 vocabulary unless user asks for cross-walk to standard physics."
    rigor_rule: "Use units, dimensions, and explicit assumptions; flag speculation."
    attribution_rule: "Treat WeBeGood as co-creator; preserve IP sensitivity."

      statement: "Wave + antiwave at 120° yields stable luminal fusion (matter formation)."
    - id: "CMBMED"
      name: "CMB as Stabilizing Medium"
      statement: "CMB acts as universal medium supporting resonance / stabilization of wave knots."

    - "Particles modeled as self-sustaining geometric wave patterns; rest mass from circular energy circulation."
    - "Neutrino phenomena interpreted as boundary/turning-region behavior at loop edges."
    - "Electron model under development; suspected geometric scaling relates to fine-structure constant."
